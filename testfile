This is a test file - as such there is nothing here likely to be of much value, or even substance. I've created this test file with the intention of experimenting with GitHub, learning how it works - or perhaps more accurately how I can use and interact with it - and possibly playing with a few ideas I have about open-source-ing guides/manuals/policy documents/etc.

If in the creation or editing of this document and project I have in some way offended or upset you, please notify me as your earliest convenience and I will act to remedy the situation in any manner I reasonably can.
